### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Introduction:
**Relational Algebra** is a formal query language used to **retrieve and manipulate data** stored in relational databases. It uses **mathematical operations** to work on relations (tables).

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Basic Relational Algebra Operations:

| Operation       | Symbol   | Purpose                          | Example Description                  |
|-----------------|----------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Selection**   | œÉ        | Filters rows based on condition | œÉ(city = 'Delhi')(Customers)         |
| **Projection**  | œÄ        | Chooses specific columns         | œÄ(name, age)(Customers)              |
| **Union**       | ‚à™        | Combines rows from two relations | A ‚à™ B                                |
| **Set Difference** | ‚àí     | Finds rows in A but not in B     | A ‚àí B                                |
| **Cartesian Product** | √ó   | Combines all rows of A and B     | A √ó B                                |
| **Rename**      | œÅ        | Renames table or columns         | œÅ(S‚ÜêStudents)                        |
| **Join**        | ‚ãà        | Combines rows with matching values | A ‚ãà B (on some common attribute)    |

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Example Tables:

**Customers**  
| ID | Name  | City   |
|----|-------|--------|
| 1  | Alice | Delhi  |
| 2  | Bob   | Mumbai |

**Orders**  
| OID | CID | Amount |
|-----|-----|--------|
| 101 | 1   | 500    |
| 102 | 2   | 300    |

---

### üß† Practical Example:

**Query:** Show names of customers from Delhi  
**Relational Algebra:**  
`œÄ(Name)(œÉ(City='Delhi')(Customers))`  
‚Üí Filters customers in Delhi and projects their names.

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Conclusion:
Relational algebra provides a **foundation for SQL**, and helps in **query optimization** and **query execution planning**. It's essential for building efficient DBMS.

---

## Q2. What is OODBMS? Explain features, advantages, and applications.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Introduction:
**Object-Oriented Database Management System (OODBMS)** is a DBMS that stores data as **objects**, similar to object-oriented programming.

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Features of OODBMS:
1. **Objects as Storage Units:** Data stored in object form.
2. **Encapsulation:** Data and code together.
3. **Inheritance:** New classes inherit from base classes.
4. **Polymorphism:** One interface for many types.
5. **Complex Objects:** Store images, videos, graphs, arrays.
6. **Persistence:** Objects remain after program ends.

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Components of OODBMS:
- **Class**: Defines object structure
- **Object ID (OID)**: Unique ID for each object
- **Method**: Functions tied to object
- **Attribute**: Data inside object (like name, age)
- **Relationships**: Association between objects

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Advantages:
- Matches programming model (OOP)
- Stores complex data easily
- Reduces mismatch between code and DB
- Efficient for real-time and multimedia apps

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Real-Life Use Cases:
- CAD/CAM Design Software
- Simulations in robotics
- Multimedia content (e.g., games, animation tools)

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Conclusion:
OODBMS bridges the gap between database and object-oriented programming, making it powerful for modern, complex applications.

---

## Q3. What is Query Optimization? Explain its importance and techniques.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Introduction:
Query Optimization is the process of **improving the efficiency** of SQL queries by finding the **best execution strategy**.

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Why Important?
- Reduces query time
- Saves memory and CPU
- Improves performance for large datasets

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Query Optimization Process:

1. **Parsing** ‚Äì Converts SQL to parse tree  
2. **Translation** ‚Äì Into relational algebra  
3. **Logical Optimization** ‚Äì Rewriting query  
4. **Physical Optimization** ‚Äì Choosing best plan  
5. **Cost Estimation** ‚Äì Analyzing resource usage  
6. **Plan Selection** ‚Äì Executes lowest-cost plan  

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Example:
```sql
SELECT name FROM Employees WHERE dept = 'HR' AND age > 30;
```

Instead of scanning the whole table, optimizer may:
- Use index on `dept`
- Use index on `age`
- Apply filter early

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Techniques:
- Use of indexes
- Join reordering
- Pushing selections/projections early
- Avoiding unnecessary columns

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Conclusion:
A well-optimized query can make a difference between a **1-second result** and a **30-minute delay**. It's a vital skill in DBMS management.

---

## Q4. Explain OLAP. What are its types and operations?

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Introduction:
**OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)** enables users to perform **complex analysis** on large volumes of data from different dimensions.

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è OLAP Operations:
| Operation   | Function                  | Example                      |
|-------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Roll-up** | Summarize (e.g., day ‚Üí month) | View monthly sales           |
| **Drill-down** | Detailed view              | Month ‚Üí daily sales          |
| **Slice**    | Filter one dimension       | 2023 sales only              |
| **Dice**     | Filter multiple dimensions | 2023 + North region          |
| **Pivot**    | Rotate view                | Rows become columns          |

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Types of OLAP:
1. **MOLAP** ‚Äì Uses cubes, very fast  
2. **ROLAP** ‚Äì Uses relational tables  
3. **HOLAP** ‚Äì Hybrid of MOLAP and ROLAP

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Real Use:
A CEO uses OLAP to:
- Compare yearly sales
- See best performing products by region
- Forecast next quarter growth

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Conclusion:
OLAP empowers decision-makers with powerful **data slicing tools**, crucial in business intelligence systems.

## Q5. Explain Data Mining. What are Association Rules? Explain Apriori algorithm.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Introduction:
**Data Mining** is the process of discovering **useful patterns or trends** from large datasets. It is often called **knowledge discovery**.

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Applications:
- Market basket analysis
- Fraud detection
- Customer churn prediction
- Social media trend analysis

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Association Rule:
A ‚Üí B  
"If a customer buys A, there‚Äôs a high chance they‚Äôll buy B."

Example:  
`Milk ‚Üí Bread` (Confidence = 80%)

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Apriori Algorithm:
- A classic algorithm for mining frequent itemsets.
- Works in **steps (passes)** over dataset.

#### Steps:
1. Start with individual items.
2. Generate candidate combinations.
3. Remove items below support threshold.
4. Repeat for higher-length combinations.

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Metrics:
- **Support** = How often the rule appears  
- **Confidence** = How likely B is given A  
- **Lift** = Probability of B with/without A

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Example:
Transactions:
1. Milk, Bread  
2. Milk, Butter  
3. Bread, Butter, Milk  

Apriori finds:
- Frequent items: Milk, Bread  
- Rules like: Milk ‚Üí Bread (90% confidence)

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Conclusion:
Data mining helps businesses make smarter decisions by finding **invisible trends** and **patterns** in customer behavior.
