## Q1. What is a Data Warehouse? Explain its architecture and components in detail.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Introduction:
A **Data Warehouse** is a central repository of integrated data collected from different sources, designed to support reporting and data analysis.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Features of Data Warehouse:
1. **Subject-Oriented** ‚Äì Organized by business areas like sales, marketing.
2. **Integrated** ‚Äì Combines data from multiple sources.
3. **Time-Variant** ‚Äì Stores historical data.
4. **Non-Volatile** ‚Äì Data is stable and not frequently changed.

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Architecture of Data Warehouse:

1. **Data Sources Layer**  
   - External DBs, files, APIs, CRM systems
   - Raw operational data (sales, finance, HR)

2. **Data Staging Layer (ETL)**  
   - **Extract:** Pulls data from source
   - **Transform:** Cleans and converts data
   - **Load:** Loads data into warehouse

3. **Data Storage Layer**  
   - Central warehouse DB (OLAP-ready)
   - Dimensional models (Star, Snowflake)

4. **Metadata Layer**  
   - Information about data origin, structure, and usage

5. **Data Presentation Layer**  
   - BI tools, dashboards, ad-hoc reports

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Components of a Data Warehouse:

| Component         | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **ETL Tools**     | For extracting, cleaning, loading data |
| **Staging Area**  | Temporary area for data prep |
| **Warehouse DB**  | Stores integrated data for analytics |
| **OLAP Tools**    | Enable slicing, dicing, drill-down |
| **Metadata**      | Describes origin, structure, rules |
| **Reporting Tools**| BI dashboards, Excel, Tableau, etc |

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Data Warehouse Example (Retail):

- **Sources**: Online store DB, POS terminals  
- **ETL**: Cleans formats like "‚Çπ", converts to USD  
- **Warehouse**: Stores 5 years of sales  
- **Analysis**: Which products sell best in festivals?

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Benefits of Data Warehousing:
- Better decision-making
- Historical data tracking
- Improved data quality
- Enables data mining and OLAP

## Q2. What is OODBMS? Explain its features, components, and advantages in detail.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Introduction:
An **Object-Oriented DBMS (OODBMS)** is a database system that supports object-oriented programming features and stores **complex data** in object form.

It integrates database capabilities with object programming language features.

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Features of OODBMS:

1. **Object Storage**  
   - Stores entire objects (attributes + methods)

2. **Encapsulation**  
   - Data and methods bundled into a single unit

3. **Inheritance**  
   - Subclasses inherit attributes from parent classes

4. **Complex Objects**  
   - Arrays, nested objects, multimedia can be stored

5. **Persistence**  
   - Objects remain stored beyond program execution

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Components of OODBMS:

| Component        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Class**         | Defines structure of object |
| **Object**        | Instance of a class |
| **Attribute**     | Field (e.g., name, age) |
| **Method**        | Function (e.g., getAge()) |
| **OID**           | Unique Object Identifier |
| **Inheritance**   | Reuse features from parent class |

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Example:

```cpp
class Student {
  int rollNo;
  string name;
  void display();
}
```

‚Üí Entire object is stored in DB, not split into rows.

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Advantages of OODBMS:

- Handles complex data (video, images)
- Improves application‚Äìdatabase alignment
- Reduces mismatch between OOP code and DB
- Efficient for CAD/CAM, scientific data, simulations

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Use Cases:

- Engineering systems (CAD)
- AI and robotics
- Simulation software
- Video editing software

---

## Q3. What is OLAP? Explain its operations with examples.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Introduction:
**OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)** helps users perform **multidimensional data analysis** quickly and interactively.

It allows users to view data from different perspectives: time, region, product, etc.

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è OLAP Operations:

| Operation   | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Roll-up** | Aggregate data | From daily to monthly sales |
| **Drill-down** | Show detailed data | Monthly ‚Üí daily view |
| **Slice** | Select a single dimension | View only "2024" sales |
| **Dice** | Filter multiple dimensions | Sales in "2024" and "Delhi" |
| **Pivot** | Rotate axes | Change rows to columns |

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Real-Life Example:

- In a supermarket:
  - OLAP answers:  
    - Which products sell best in May?  
    - Compare sales by store and region  
    - What‚Äôs the trend over 3 years?

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è OLAP Types:

1. **MOLAP** (Multidimensional) ‚Äì Fast, uses cubes  
2. **ROLAP** (Relational) ‚Äì Uses relational DB  
3. **HOLAP** (Hybrid) ‚Äì Combines both

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è OLAP vs OLTP:

| Feature        | OLAP                        | OLTP                    |
|----------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Use            | Analysis                    | Daily transactions       |
| Speed          | Optimized for reading       | Optimized for writing    |
| Data Type      | Historical                  | Current/live             |
| Example        | Data analysis reports       | Bank deposit/withdrawal  |

## Q4. Explain Association Rules in Data Mining with Algorithms.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Definition:
**Association rule mining** finds **relationships** between items in large datasets.

It helps answer: "If item A is bought, what is the chance that item B is also bought?"

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Example Rule:
‚ÄúIf a person buys bread and butter, they are 80% likely to buy jam.‚Äù

### üìå Key Measures:
- **Support**: % of transactions containing A & B  
- **Confidence**: How often B occurs when A does  
- **Lift**: How much A boosts chances of B

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Algorithms:

#### 1. Apriori Algorithm:
- Works by **generating frequent itemsets**
- Scans DB multiple times
- Prunes combinations below threshold

#### 2. FP-Growth Algorithm:
- Faster and efficient
- Uses a tree structure (FP-Tree)
- Avoids multiple DB scans

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Real Use Cases:
- Amazon recommending related items
- Market Basket Analysis in retail
- Diagnosing patients based on symptom patterns

## Q5. What is Query Optimization? Explain its steps, cost estimation and evaluation plan.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Introduction:
**Query Optimization** is the process of choosing the **most efficient way** to run a SQL query with the **least time and resource usage**.

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Steps in Query Optimization:

1. **SQL Parsing**  
   ‚Üí Converts SQL into a query tree

2. **Relational Algebra Translation**  
   ‚Üí Builds equivalent algebraic expressions

3. **Plan Generation**  
   ‚Üí Multiple ways to run the same query

4. **Cost Estimation**  
   ‚Üí Predicts I/O, CPU, memory usage

5. **Best Plan Selection**  
   ‚Üí Chooses the lowest cost query plan

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è What is Query Evaluation Plan?

A step-by-step set of instructions on how DBMS will run the query:
- Join order
- Index usage
- Selection & projection order

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Cost Estimation Parameters:

- Size of data (rows)
- Index available
- Join method used (nested loop, merge join)
- Disk I/O needed

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Real-Life Analogy:
